This folder explains the Theoretical Analysis behind ***Quantum Teleportation***. The ***Theory*** gives a brief explanation to the ***Quantum Teleportation*** and how
it is performed.

### ${Quantum \space Teleportation}$
Quantum Teleportation is the process of ***Quantum Mechanics*** by which the state of a Quantum bit is transferred to another Quantum bit via ***Quantum Entanglement***.
The Quantum Teleportation is not a process of copying rather ***transferring the state*** from one Qbit to another thus, when transferring the state of the Qbit 
the ***previous state of the target Qbit gets destroyed***.

### ${Performing \space Quantum \space Teleportation}$

We take two Qbits and two Classical Bits for measuring the Qbits at a particular instance. Then, we apply a Hadamard Gate to provide superposition to a Qbit. Since control negation gate changes the state of the Qbit as per the input Qbit value. Thus, the two Qbits enter into a Superposition state.
