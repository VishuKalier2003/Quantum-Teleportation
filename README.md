# ${Quantum \space Teleportation}$

This project explains the ***Quantum Teleportation Concepts*** of ***Quantum Mechanics*** such that the state of a Qbit is transferred to other Qbit using ***Quantum
Entanglement***. The ***coordination of states of Qbits happens faster than the speed of light via Superposition***. This project describes the ***essence of Quantum Teleportation*** in Quantum Computers since the Classical Cut and Paste method of Qbits does not work in Quantum Computers or Quantum Mechanics.
